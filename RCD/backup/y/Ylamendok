Bio          Thousands of millenia ago, a great being known as the Dragon-God created that
which we known as dragons. It had 9 heads: Red,White,Blue,Green,Black,Copper
Bronze,Silver, and Gold. From each of these heads it pulled a scale and 
from those scales the first dragons of each species were born. From the white
scale Ylamendok was born. From the red scale Pyroshoker was born. No one knows
the names of the other 7 dragon patriarchs, or Wyrmkings as they have dubbed
themselves.
