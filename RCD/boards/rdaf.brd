Our outposts are expanding throughout the realms, hopefully this will help
us combat the ninja threat and future menaces to the city. The ninjas have
been very quiet lately, I think they must be up to something.

Hello guys,
It has come to my attention that recently, a load of new PK characters
have come to this MUD. And a lot of those that know the way around a
bit _too_ well, if you know what I mean.
They're also all joining the OOC, hence, people are making new players
and they all like argon (weird but true).
Now I was thinking, maybe we should hold back on easily inviting new
players into rdaf. Specially the ones they know the game too well.
Argon has asked me to see those RDAF-only things a lot of times
(of course I declined) but he knows we have some powerful equip.
So infiltration might be his next idea! So mind those new guys, they
might be traitors! We may not let those traitors get our stuff ;)
Regards, Ath

Again I posted an annoying note, but what the heck
this related to one of our member and my sister
Zilnessa.....
 
She's now attend a "semi" militery high school
in RL so dont expect much from her now, since
she only got free-time on sunday :(
 
Again on her behalf I ask for apologies, especially
for you dundead, you better find another replacement
for her ( sigh )
 
The god news is Zagard my cousin is also attending 
the same school as she is so you can say good bye
to a OOC will be member :) (sayonara Zagard, forever I hope :) )
 
Well thats all, and for me, since in my home town
the network and connection are VERY crappy perhaps i can back
online FOR REAL 2 or 3 week from now. For now
I can only online for a while to see the
situation in here. :(

I am officially out of the RDAF development project, so you're on your
own now, even if you have to face the menacing order of chaos.
 
as per bradley's suggestion, please address it to cyph, marten, or fellon
they will help you with it. ok, i wish you all the greatest strength to
fight against the evil forces! may the force be with you!

We are going to (most likely) start a PK clan under the leadership
of Bradley. This clan will be an offshoot of the RDAF responsible
primarily to deal with PKillers who treaten the security and peaceful
lives in DarkHaven, which only pkillers may combat. It will be 
possible to switch from peaceful to pkiller for those who are interested in
joining (this is a one-way switch though) and we will be recruiting new
PK players for it. Right now their primary adversary will be the ever
present and very destructive order of chaos. Anyone who is interested in
joining this new clan, please note vote <this note> yes so we know who
is interested.

I think making a PK section of the RDAF is just giving the OOC what
they want. If you're not a PK yourself, you should have nothing to fear
from those choas clowns. What troubles me more is their demonic
posession. That did threaten the peaceful people of darkhaven.
I might make a new character to kill the OOC, and for fun too.
 
I dont like to watch my *ss all the time, when those mages can easily
portal to you and zap your *ss while you sleep. :) hehe.
Anyway, I'm not stopping you guys to go PK, its just not my style :)
good luck, and may argon be offline while you kill Maelstrom ;)

It has come to my attention that the RDAF has quite a bunch of vampires
as members. Vampires, the guys who really need blood.
(Zilnessa, Janos, ...) if we die, it takes ages to get back to full
health. Thats why maybe, the RDAF should hold some blood stored for
the hurt vampires. It would certainly speed up the rate at which we
get back on our feet.
I'm thinking along the lines of a nice fountain or something :)
It would be the rations counter part for us ;D

a) blood fountains are a great idea, unforunately they don't work I'll
talk to fellon about fixing them.
b) I think koronike has completed enough tasks to let him in, even if
he is a spy we can't let him know that we know that he's a spy. :]
But make sure you take down this note before you do it.
