Here stands the newly created builders board. Rignt in the middle of
the transport room. (Rather convenient I think). You can post build 
stuff here for now until someone decides to move it in some great
ellaborate scheme to improve on our realms.

In case you're wondering why the board is in my den, it's because I 
decided to turn my den into a transport room that anyone is more than
welcome to utilize whenever they wish. I see this place possibly 
becoming a high traffic area for frantic builders so why not put
the board here too? If anyone has a better idea speak up! otherwise
, here is where it shall remain i guess
