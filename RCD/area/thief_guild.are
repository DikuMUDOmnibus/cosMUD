Seedy was one of the most feared cut throats in darkhaven in his youth
The effects of these many years can be seen in his face, and in the many
old wounds on his body. But now he seems slightly on edge, and has become a
merchant to be just as feared.

The statue of Thirian shows him with two heads, one is the battered and cruel
face of a cut throat, the other is the laughing face of the devine joker.
On his body he wears light and torn robes that might be found on a begger,
and in a mockery of the lady of justice, he holds a pair of dice in his left
hand, and a dagger in his right.

Inside The Wall~
The sounds of the city can be distantly heard here. Only a little light flows
into this room, so that it is hard to see many details. Along the southern
wall some words can be made out, and a trapdoor can be seen in the centre of
the room.

Under The Wall~
This room looks like an empty wine cellar about to burst inwards. The weight
of the city wall above shows in the cracks and broken debris scattered about
the room. The walls themselves are made of aged cut stone with a few wooden
supports for the roof, even the floor stones are chipped and damaged.
There is a small stairway in one corner leading to a trapdoor in the roof,
while a ladder goes down to the guild dump. The only other exit is an arched
empty hallway to the east.

The Dump~
Here the guild members throw their unwanted possessions. Items they thought
they would need, but as it turns out didn't, some items here have just been
outgrown over time.
It's not uncommon to find thieves hunting through the piles of junk,
looking for that one item that just might save their neck a little longer.

An Arched Hallway~
This hallway is made entirely of stone, forming an single long archway.
The hallway itself is not lit, however light flows in from the surrounding
rooms. In particular the light from a room to the south seems strange,
more of a glow than a bright light. At the eastern end it opens into the
lounge of the thieves guild, and to the west is a room leading the way out
of the guild.

Thiad The Cleric's Room~
This room belongs to Thiad, one of the few clerics that follow the ways of
the thief god. A strange glow seems to be cast from the walls themselves,
perhaps the effect of the countless healings that have been performed here.
In one corner a statue of Thirian can be seen, and beside it a small
fountain, along the walls there are a few patches of dried blood, apart from
that though the room looks rather clean and well kept.
The only exit is the door to the north, leading into the hallway.

The Thieves Lounge~
This is where thieves come to meet and discuss the day, or nights, business.
Around the room there are some chairs and a small table with a deck of
playing cards on it. The floor is made of wood, and has a stairway leading
to a room below. The stone walls are broken and cracked like most of the
rooms in the guild of thieves. To the west can be seen a long arched
hallway, while a door to the south opens into Seedy's room. The other door
is in the east and is the enterance to the guild masters office.

Seedy's Room~
This is the room of the infamous thief Seedy. Seedy has now retired from the
life of a thief, and now makes his money by selling various items gathered
from all over the land, although no one is sure how he gets many of the items,
since he rarely leaves the guild. The room itself is plain, with little more
than a bed and a wooden chest. The only exit is to the north.

The Strange Room~
Something in the shape of this room seems odd, as if it has been turned
slightly. Here the note board stands so that thieves of the guild may keep
in contact with each other. The room seems to be in better shape than many
in the guild, and only has one exit up.

Guild Master's Office~
This is the work room of the guild master.
In the middle of the room there is a fine wooden desk, and on the wall there
is a painting of the guild master and a fine silver plaque with the guild
codes of conduct engraved on it. Apart from that the room looks like any
other in the thieves guild, with the same old stone walls, floors and roof
although the door to the west seems to have been replaced.

A Dark Tunnel~
There is little room inside this tunnel, few people could fit in here.
It does not appear very old, but has had some supports put in place to
hold the roof up. There is little sign of anyone ever being here, though
some muffled sounds can be heard faintly.
