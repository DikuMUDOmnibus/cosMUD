The blade of the sword is a full meter long and straight as an arrow, with
lightly-fluted sides.  Both edges are keened down to perfect lines, invisibly
sharp.  Perfection like this could have only been forged by a god.  The black
hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of a white arrow.
Upon the blade is engraved a poem:

                      Farslayer howls across the world
                      For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!
                      Vengeance is his who casts the blade
                      Yet he will in the end no triumph see.

Hall of the Damned~
This hallway is a monument to the millions of damned souls in Hell.
The walls are made up of various body parts and other, unidentifiable
things. Many of the faces that make up the wall scream out to you for
help. Their arms desperately grasp at your clothing as you pass.

This room is filled with instruments of torture. Beings of all shapes and
sizes are being brought to the thresholds of pain and beyond. Some are
being sliced into thousands of pieces.  Others are being stretched as though
they were made of rubber.  All are caught in an unending play of agony.

This is an ancient, abandoned shrine of some unknown god. It has been
vandalized and torn apart. What used to be the shrine has been reduced to
a large pile of stone and other debris. Various runes and demonic faces
have been spray-painted on the walls and floor.  Nailed to the ceiling are
an assortment of skeletons.  All seem to have been dead for a very long
time. All surfaces of the room are covered with dried blood and dust.

Fire Mural~
Apon all the walls of this room is an enormous mural. Pictures of burning
bodies and tortured souls seem to be the main theme of the art. Bright reds
and hot blues are enphasized throughout the mural. As you stare at it the
characters within it seem to move and struggle in pain. The hot air around
you smells of sulfur and methane. To the south you see a stone hallway.
Hot air blows in at you from the doorway. The air stirs up the methane and
steals your breath. You choke and gag...

to move slowly changing the layout of the room. As you examine the room
further you notice various posts around the room to which people are
chained. The firewalls seem to move in patterns that leave the poor
people directly in the path of the oncoming fire. The walls seem to creep
ever so slowly towards them. The people blister and scream as the fire gets
closer. Their deaths seem like minutes of agony and pain, and even as they
burst into flames they seem incapable of grasping the merciful attention of
death...

Court Room~
This is the Courts of Hell. Here you are convicted, sentenced and punished.
And no...you don't get a trial. You don't deserve one. The courtroom is
filled with spectators and jury members. They seem to have no real reason
to be here since there isn't going to be a trial. They jeer and boo you as you
stand in the middle of the courtroom.

Lawyers Office~
As you look around you, you realize you've entered a lawyers office. Now
you know you are in Hell....Everything in this office seems to be made of
snakeskin. This is the only lawyers office in Hell, so if you don't  like them
you're out of luck. But then again...if you are in Hell...you must've run
out of luck a while ago.

trinkets at the town of Solace. He has recently set up shop in Hell selling
magical figurines. Each figurine is in the shape of some sort of steed.
Some are recognizable and some are not. Rumor has it that Stanley made
a deal with a devil....so I guess his lease is up in seven years.....
