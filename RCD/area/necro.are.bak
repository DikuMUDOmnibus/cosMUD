rabbits.  The exit east leads back to the entrance hall.

The Healer~
For those who work so close to death, there is always a risk of finding it.
This room has been set aside for a healer to ease the many pains which the
members of the guild find in their study. The main hall is to the west.

Donation Room~
This room is littered with trophies and the bones of past victories, 
unlike thieves who steal to survive, necromancers will often keep items 
from those who they have possessed and slain as symbols of their power 
and for use by their fellow guild members.  There is a an exit south
back to the guild entrance.

The Quarters~
The air has a thin quality of height beyond the imagination here in this 
large hall. Eight of the exits from this hall lead into the rooms which
are left for the use of the elder members of the guild of necromancers.
The exit down leads to the main hall, and up is the guild master's office.

Masters Office~
The top floor of the tower is the leaders room, there is little sign of 
any real use.  Theres a few bones and tomes of arcane knowledge scattered 
around.  At pride of place is the leaders chair, this has been carefully 
constructed using the body of a past servant.  The only exit is down 
back to the living quarters.
