East Taldon Avenue Joins Park Street~
East Taldon Avenue arrives in this intersection from the east; here it
splits off to go around The Park to the south-west; the avenue itself
continues west, while Park Street heads south. Just north of here, the trees
of Executioner Park enshroud the figure of a looming statue.

East Taldon Avenue North of The Park~
The cobblestone avenue runs straight east to west along the tree-shaded
northern edge of The Park. The well-established blacksmith's forge lies to
the north of the road from which occasional metallic sounds eminate. In the
forest to the south-west, a thin dirt path barely squeezes out of the trees.

East Taldon Avenue North of The Park~
This part of the park road has a small stream flowing underneath it.
Flowing water is vital to the metal workers located along this section
of the road.  The Armorer can be found in his well equipped workshop to 
the north. East Taldon road continues along the parkside east and west.

East Taldon Avenue North of The Park~
The cobbled park road is well shaded here on account of the large oak
trees that overhang the path. The clang of metal on metal can be heard
from the Weaponsmith's store situated north.  The northwest corner of
the park can be found a short walk to the west, a small stream and the
continuing stretch of East Taldon Avenue to the east.

The Corner of East Taldon Avenue and Commerce Street~
The north west corner of the park offers the best views, a small wall 
restricts access to the centre of the park, looking further afield 
you can make out a stone circle deep within the oaks.  To the east are 
the metal shops, the south the dealers in magic.  A shortcut to Acadamy 
road is to the north-west.

Commerce Street to discourage pickpockets from targeting customers of the
reputable merchants located around the park. This section is particularly
quiet as the scribe's library lies open to the west.

Commerce Street~

beauty of the park to the east.  The entrance west would appear to be the home 
and store of the towns resident mage, who caters to those who work within the 
magical arts.  Commerce street continues north and south.

Commerce Street~
A fresh sea breeze gusts up the street swirling leaves around and dumping them
against the large wooden gate on the building to the east.  A smell wafts 
through an open window and makes your stomach gag, looking through the window 
you can make out some beakers bubbling away, this must be the Alchemist's Lab. 
Gazing south you see the junction of Commerce Street and West Taldon Avenue, to
the north Commerce Street continues.

West Taldon Avenue by the Ocean~
Free of the obstructions of the fish market and docks to the east, the iron
railing that runs along the seawall provides a good place to stop and
take in the long stretch of sands down below the seawall.  Out to sea gulls 
swoop over the fishing boats that are dragging in their nets.  A small 
dirt trail leads north east through the park, the meeting of West Taldon
Avenue and commercial street is a short walk west.  East leads to the piers.

sea wall and West Talron avenue continue to the east and west.

The cobbled stone street meets with a small wooden jetty that leads to the
marina and passenger port, oaks from the park provide some shelter from the hot
sun during the day, the proximity to the port and commerce street make this an
area of oppurtunity for street entertainers and beggars.  West Taldon Avenue
continues to the east and west.

The Corner of West Taldon Avenue and Park Street~
Park Street comes to an abrupt end at the stone seawall to the south, past
which many small boats lie along a maze of docks. West Taldon Road runs west
from here between the docks and The Park to the north-west. In the distance on
the ocean, traces of the ruins of New Darkhaven barely extend from the surface.

stationary shop to the east into darkness.  Park Road continues uphill north

West Taldon Avenue by the Beach~
The waves roll on to the sandy beach, stones swept up by the spring lay 
untouched in the gutters that run either side of the road.  Gulls swoop 
overhead scavenging for food left at this popular recreation point. Looking 
past the surf and across the clear blue sea you can spot some vessels 
travelling to the port to the east.  West Taldon Avenue continues to the east
and west.

Atop the North-Eastern Rampart~
Curving around the buildings of the city, the wall heads south and north-

A Turret Atop the Western Guard Tower~
This turret sharply cuts off the beach to the east by extending slightly
into the ocean, making it impossible to get around Taldon's walls. The
western path can be seen streching into the pixie forest, well covered by
sharpshooting positions behind balistraria that line the embattled parapet
around the turret. A large ballista faces southwards, covering the harbour.

feel calmer walking by. A group of swans take off, disturbed by your

of the land.

south, the way continues out into the ocean along a floating causeway. A
well-defended door opens to the west on the side of the lighthouse.

Taldron Final Room~
We don't really want to have 1000000 vnums lagging this area, so I've cut it
to 700, which is more than DH even had originally and fits in
nicely with the following room sceme that makes it easy to set sectors
and flags with rat:
4000000 - 4000099 = city sector; streets around town
4000100 - 4000199 = indoors; standard town buildings
4000200 - 4000299 = outdoors on the city walls, building rooves / archways
4000300 - 4000399 = parks, paths out of town (mostly in roads.are), misc.
4000400 - 4000799 = currently empty, could be assigned for future uses
4000800 - 4000899 = marten's slum area outside of town
4000900 - 4000998 = quest stuff, temp rooms, extra rooms, etc.
4000999           = final room
I've created a map of this area as a rough guilde to building. See help map3.
