A Dark Alleyway~
The walls of the alleyway have been spray-painted over many times
over the years.  One section of graffiti actually looks legible,
it says:    This section has been designed for levels 5 through 10
            If you are above level 15 please don't expect much fun.
            If you are below level 5 enter at your own risk.
Another section of graffiti says "Raff Rules!"
There is a boulevard to the east and Wall Road East is to the west.

Beginning of White Dragon Boulevard~
This section of town has been overrun by the Troll gang.  Even the
police stay out of here for fear of being brutalized.  This was once
a nice lower-middleclass neighborhood, but know the gangs run the
streets.  All the shops and homes have been boarded up and abandoned.
An alleyway is to the west and the street continues east.  An over-
grown lot is to the south.

The street is full of garbage here.  An odd building lies to the west,
but you don't seem to be able to find a way into it.  The street
runs north and south here.

Achilles Avenue~
The town bards sang of the victory parades that used to pass along this
route.  It was once a major way through the center of town.  The street
goes south to a bend and north to an intersection.

A small ruined chapel~
This was a small temple built to honor the minor gods and goddesses.
It is now desecrated by graffiti and vandalism.  Perhaps its worst
defilement is that it is the hangout of the Ogre gang.  There is a street to
the east through a rusty metal door.

The temple to honor the minor gods is through a rusty metal door
to the west.  The street continues north and south.  You hear the
muffled sounds of screams coming from the chapel.

First intersection of Hector and Achilles~
There is a large statue here depicting a battle between two
great warriors.  You think it's odd that it has not been defiled,
but then you sense a aura protecting it.  Achilles runs east
and south, while Hector heads out to the north.

What is left of the weaponshop~
It doesn't even look like those punks gave the weaponsmith a
proper burial.  But what a going away present he seems to have
received!  Blood is splattered and dried all over the walls here.
It looks like a great deal of carnage happened here.  The way
out to the east leads out onto a street.

Khan Park~
Not really a "park" as you and i would think of it but
it seems queerly peaceful here in comparison to the rest of
the area.  There seems to be some kind of memorial to the
great Mongol warrior Khan being crudely constructed here.
There is a street to the east and another to the south.

A wide alleyway~
The sides of the alleyway have been vandalized many times.
One patch of graffiti actually looks readable:
            This section has been designed for levels 5 through 10
            If you are above level 10 please don't expect much.
            If you are below level 5 enter at your own risk.
In another spot it says "now entering Ogre territory..."
A street lies to the west and a major road to the east.

Alexander Road~
You see many gang members walking around looking for
fights to pick and things to break.  It seems as if all of the
other citizens have been run out of town.  All the former
homes are boarded up and uninhabitable.  The road continues
east and west.

The inn actually looks fairly functional despite its lack
of repair.  The boys come here to hoot it up and drink them selves
into oblivion sometimes.  It looks as if the beer is still on tap!!!
A hallway leads south and you spy a street through the doorway
to the north.

evils along the road to the east and west.
