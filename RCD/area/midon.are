" . . . the exits of the caverns seemed to flow about us and our compasses flew
every which way. Strange creatures persisted in picking up the food we'd left
as a trial. We were about to give up, but that the oracle told us it would take
at least a day to traverse the caves and it had but been a few hours . . . "

This ancient parchment is coded in an esoteric languguage, long lost, but has
been classified beside the red book for some reason. After many pages of
unintelligible markings, the final passage is heavily underlined: "asha tch

The Obelisk Chamber~
In a circle about the centre of this chamber, a series of strange, untarnished
obelisks seem to draw heat from the ground. The purpose of these artifacts is
unfathomable.

The walls of this room are unnaturally smooth, in contrast to the rest of the

a myriad of dots, stars perhaps, and giant ring of . . . a moon? There don't
appear to be any artifacts or strange formations anywhere nearby.

Looking closer, you notice that a message has been scrawled on the side,
"The Oracle was here!"

The Abyssal Caverns~
This tunnel seems to have once followed a well-laid path of smooth floors, but
seems to have deteriorated into rubble over time. Basaltic tunnels still
stretch out in all directions away from the flat floor.

A Painting Room~
The walls of this room are unnaturally smooth, similar to the moon room. The
chamber is also cubic in shape. On the ceiling is painted a myriad of stars and
half a giant spiked circle.

Given the previous moon room, it only seems natural that this would be half
a sun.

A Crumbling Room~
The path leading south away from this room has deteriorated completely, and the
decay seems to have started in on this room too. Its cubic shape clearly
reveals it as another painting room, but the painting on the ceiling is badly
worn and can't be made out at first glance.

A Room of Ruins~
This room, and the path leading west from it have been completely destroyed by
erosion, tarnishing, looting, and heat. The nearly-cubic shape reveals that it
is probably another painting room, but there is nothing but rubble to look at.

An Unstable Cave~
All sides of this small room look delicate, stacked with porous rocks that
appear to be ready to tumble at any moment. The cave opening leads back into
the maze of caverns to the west. If you're lucky, perhaps you can cause some
of these rocks to crumble and reveal another way out of here
