Dark Hallway~
The assassins guild is a cold sombre affair.  Most Assassins work alone and do
not need the support of others, meeting only to share intelligence and obtain
their specialist brought in from distant lands.  The guild healer can be found
through an archway to the west.  To the east the Assassin trainer is helping
new recruits practice the shadow arts.  The guild exit is to the south and
the guild continues to the north.

Healing Corner~
The healers room is a simple affair, torches hang from the walls to give a
brighter light than the other rooms in the guild.  A resting place and a water
fountain are provided to speed recovery.

Master of Shadows~
The home of the resident trainer contains a wide range of equipment covering
many varied fighting styles, as well as a selection of poisons and herbs, used 
to kill or disable his target.  A training mat used to soften the blows he 
inflicts on his students sits on the floor.  The exit west leads back to the 
guild entrance.
