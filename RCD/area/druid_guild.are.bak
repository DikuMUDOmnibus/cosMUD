#ROOMS
#60801
The Guild of Druids~
The ancient cellar of the Temple of Darkhaven has been reconstructed into
a magnificent guild hall.  Potted plants line the walls of the main hall,
while creeping vines cover the walls.  In the center of the room, seven
black lacquer chairs circle an oaken table.  Four corridors lie in the
four cardinal directions, while the thud of staff striking staff
emerges from a room to the south. To the east was found a newly discovered
corridor.

The Trial of Lore~
This room is where the druids come to train and meditate.  A large circle
formed of green shrubs lies in the center of the room, and within it spar
two elder druids, each wielding a heavy oaken staff.  A corridor to the
north leads back to the main hall of the Guild of Druids.

A Room of Silence~
This strange room is rather empty, save for a single oaken podium which
sits in the center of the eerily silent chamber.  Upon it rests a tome so
fraught with age that its pages are a sickened yellow.  This is where the
druids of the guild leave messages for one another.  A corridor to the
east leads back to the main hall of the Guild of Druids.

Storage Room~
This spacious room is where the druids of the guild leave items for their
fellow druids, and mounds of equipment, scrolls and potions are lying here.
The tiled floor of the large room is covered with runes of preservation and
permanence, giving you the feeling that items in this room could survive
even the greatest of disasters.

Room of Secrets and Wisdom~
This place looks like a library. Books are all over the place. One big round
table is in the center of the room. Many accient books are opened just
on top of the table...like someone was reading them.
Some of the books are so antique that just by looking at them they
desintegrate. This room is for you to read, learn and medidate to increase
your wisdom. This is a silent room.
If you bring a new book, please put it in the table.
