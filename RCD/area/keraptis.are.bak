ctenmiir vampire~
Ctenmiir~
A pale faced man clad all in black steps out of the shadows.
~
Compelled by a curse to remain here, Ctenmiir will fanatically attack
any who enter his tomb and/or attempt to steal the treasures he guards,
including, perhaps, one of the three fabled artifacts stolen by
Keraptis.

A gargantuan crustacean, over forty feet long, rears before you.

This crustacean is by far the largest you have ever seen. Truly a
fitting guardian for one of the stolen artifacts, this mighty beast
would make gumbo for thousands if you could find a pot big enough.

air elemental~
an air elemental~
The air in a section of the room coalesces into a translucent humanoid form.
~
Summoned by Keraptis, this confused and angry elemental was thrown in
here and kept within by a series of magical wards until the demented
mage could make up his mind what to do with it. It is quite mindless,
and will lash out at anything it perceives to be alien.

keraptis mad mage~
Keraptis~
A deranged mage screams and gibbers madly.
~
Once an evil warlock and ruler of a kingdom that he held in sway with
his legions of fanatical gnomes, Keraptis was overthrown, and fled
to this mountain retreat, where he has slowly gone quite mad, to the
point where much of his evil nature has been replaced by a simply crazy
one. He stole the three artifacts in a fit of pique, and is unlikely
to return them; having people perish in search of them amuses him to
no end.

Tetnaobylgus~
Tetnaobylgus~
A rather deranged looking vampire screams incoherently.
~
A former employee of Keraptis, leader of his fanatic gnomes, Tet has
fallen on hard times, and gone as insane as his master (not like they
were ever exactly stable people in the first place...). He now wanders
the halls of his master's lair, aimlessly and with great anger at the
world that he sees as having betrayed him. Still, he cries out his old
battlecry, even now; the haunting sound of 'STONE!' rings in your ears.

Base of the Rusted Stair~
The staircase descends about thirty or forty yards into the depths
of the mountain, arriving finally in a small stone chamber, knee deep
in scum-coated water. The air is damp, humid and reeks of various odors.
A variety of fungi and molds thrive in this damp atmosphere coating
the stone walls with their slick growth. Your feet sink into ankle deep
mud that covers the floor, causing you to check for purchase with each
step lest you lose your footing and slip on the muck. White algae gives
off a dim luminescense, insufficient to see by, but enough to distract
you when viewed from the corner of your eye. A narrow passage heads east
from here.

Scummy Water~
You progress, with a small degree of difficulty, down the wet passage,
sloshing through mud and water in irritation; besides the awful smell
and the disgusting growths, this has to be the most disgusting part of
this expedition. The passage continues north into the darkness, and
whatever it contains. Surely a mage, even an insane one, such as Keraptis
could find a better place to lair?

Barred Passage~
The passage ends abruptly here, at a shimmering force field, which
blocks the tunnel northwards. Beyond it you can see a junction, with
several passages leading deeper into the mountain, though you cannot
see any way past this particular obstacle. Deep claw marks on the wall
indicate that something else is here, however, perhaps a guardian or
a creature trapped and confused like you?

An Unpleasant Surprise~
You trudge sullenly along the northeast branch, sloshing through the
water, which gradually rises to waist height as the passage descends
slightly. Terrific. The slime is only a foot or two away from your
face now, as is the horrid odor. You try to ignore the feeling that
strange things are brushing against your feet in the water, and put
the tingling sensation down to nerves. But when the tingling sensation
intensifies to a burning pain, you wrench a leg from the water, and are
horrified to see green slime eating through the sole of your boot!
Fortunately you react in time, scraping it off with a spare dagger,
and the damage to you (or your equipment) is not as great as it could
have been.

A Turn in the Passage~
The passage turns here, and rises slightly, lowering the water back
to your knees, which is a tremendous blessing in and of itself. Bones
and rotting corpses protrude from the water at random intervals, the
remnants of past adventurers fallen pray to various foes. Bits of flesh
bob on the water, slowly putrefying and releasing a horrendous stench.
Gagging, you put one sleeve over your mouth and continue.

A Dark Junction~
The passage branches here, affording the traveller three choices of
direction- north, west and south. The northern and western branches
disappear into the darkness, while the southern passage ends after
a short distance before a wooden door. Curious that you have not thus
far encountered terribly many guardians; surely a wizard's domicile would
have tighter security measures?

A Water Swollen Door~
The door to the south is soaked and damp, and has swollen in its frame,
making it difficult to open. The water level may not even be constant
inside the room, meaning you take the risk of engulfing whatever may
lie within in a deluge of filthy water. But you see no other alternative
should you wish to examine the interior of this chamber.

A Damp Cell~
Giving the door a good shove, you force it open enough to squeeze
into the room within. A small gush of water accompanies you, but the
water level inside is only slightly lower than without and the effect
is not dramatic. The water bobs with broken glass spheres, smashed by
some unknown intruder, and the contents float about alongside them
on the muck-covered surface. Most of it appears to be junk, though
you think you see the glint of gold in one of the spheres. You also
think you detect movement within and around this particular object...

A Wooden Door~
The passage north is barred by a thick wooden door bound with rusted
iron. Slight swelling has occured in the wood, causing it to bulge
unnaturally in the frame, which will make it difficult to open. There
is no way of knowing what may lie behind this portal; as with all areas
of the deranged mage's refuge, there is a surprise around every corner.

Another Failed Experiment~
The door opens onto what was once a laboratory of some sort. Empty
wooden boxed and glass jars bob on the knee deep water, in and around
several tables and benches that protrude from the scummy water. Jars
of body parts, on shelves set high along the barren stone walls, and
the remnants of a badly burned corpse laden with electrodes is strapped
to a wooden rack near the far wall, partially obscuring a second door
in the far wall. Obviously the site of some failed experiment to create
artificial life, this place has not been used in some time, save by
whatever deranged beast still lives here to rampage in abandon through.
Anything of value that once existed here has long since been demolished.

A Turnstile~
At this point, a narrow set of stairs leads up about three feet, to a
section of floor that is dry and relatively clean. Eager to be free of
the muck, you jump up the stairs and are happy when the sound of leather
meeting hard, solid stone greets your ears instead of the soft squishy
sound you had grown accustomed to as they sunk into the muck. Pausing to
gather your bearings, you note that the passage bends sharply, heading
east. This way is barred by a solid steel turnstile, remarkably devoid of
rust. Some wag has jammed the turnstile, welding several iron bars at odd
angles, which prevents it from turning. The onyl way past would be to
use brute force, or magic.

Another Bend~
The passage beyond the turnstile bends again, heading south. The dry
stone floor is covered in dust, dust which shows no recent tracks.
Either most adventurers were stopped by the turnstile, or whatever lurks
to the south of here was considered too difficult to handle! No matter,
press on you must, for the thrill of adventure is in your blood, and be
damned if you will be dissuaded by simple fears and superstitions! A
slight red glow can be seen to the south, emanating around the edges and
between the panels of an oaken door.

A Slippery Ledge~
The door opens onto a narrow ledge, slick with moisture. Perched
rather precariously at the northwestern end of a long, narrow chasm,
you reel back as you stride in, almost toppling over the edge into the
river of bubbling mud that fills the bottom of the chasm. Even from here
the heat is intense, and you don't like to think of what might befall you
should you topple down into the muck below. Bubbles of air rise through the
mud, exploding with loud squishy pops, and occasionally a gout of boiling
water and mud will erupt from the surface, a few stray drops of water 
stinging you as they land on your arms. There doesn't appear to be any way
across, unless you can fly, in which case you could head for a similar ledge
to the southeast.

Soaring Above the Mud~
It is with great trepidation that you begin your journey across the
chasm, ever aware of the possibility of a geyser erupting and catching
you fair in the chest, slamming you into the ceiling, and then your
stunned form plummeting into the boiling mud far, far below. Pushing
such thoughts from your mind, you concentrate on the far platform, some
eighty yards away, pushing yourself to get there as quickly as possible.

Safety?~
The ledge on the far side of the river of mud is much wider than its
neighbor to the northwest. It is with a sigh of relief that you set down
on this stony precipice, and consider your options. Safe for the moment
from the boiling geysers, you turn to examine your surroundings and notice
a stone colored door set in the south wall, barely noticeable from more
than a few feet away. A small handle is set into the center, which turns
easily at your touch. A strange chill, noticeable even in the vicinity
of the heat radiating from below, emanates from the door; or more accurately
from around the door.

A Cramped Crawlspace~
The door opens onto a narrow crawlspace, no wider than a few feet,
which would make even a dwarf feel a little claustrophobic. The gloom
is resistant to the penetration of your light, and you cannot see further
than a foot or two in any direction within the crawlspace. A second door,
similar to the first, lies at the far end. Creeping cautiously through
the darkness, you press on.

The Tomb of Ctenmiir~
Inky blackness beckons at the end of the crawlspace, cold, loathsome
darkness that envelops and threatens to engulf you; you shudder at the
imagined deathly cold touch. Then you realize that the touch was not
imagined. Something lives here, in this room filled with darkness that
no light may dispel. Something vile, something dark and wicked, older
and more evil than the passing of countless centuries can measure or
compare. And you have no doubt that the primary goal of this heinous
unseen foe is to extinguish all light and life.

A Water Filled Passageway~
The water here rises to waist depth as the passage descends slightly,
heading north towards a place where it ends in a large water filled room.
The scum floating on the surface of the water exudes a powerful, rotting
odor that makes you feel rather ill and dizzy. Various other objects bob
in the water or brush against your legs. The whole journey is extremely
unpleasant, and you find yourself fervently hoping for dry ground soon.

The Water-Filled Chamber~
The passage ends here, on a ledge that circles the edge of a large
water filled chamber. The stone of the ledge can be seen beneath your
feet, even through this murky water, and the point where it disappears,
giving way to the depth of the chamber is clearly visible. It would be
possible to circle the chamber, sticking to the ledge that heads around
the western edge, and reach the exit on the northern wall, or you could
brave a trip across the deeper section to the north, significantly
reducing the time the journey would take, but also meaning you would have
to brave whatever perils may lurk here.

Various growths on the walls and floor make progress, when combined
with the fact you have to wade through filthy thigh deep water, rather
difficult. You fancy you can see strange shapes moving about in the
depths of the pool, and feel glad that you decided to stick to the 
ledge. To the north, the ledge narrows significantly, enabling but one
person to make their way through at a time.

The ledge narrows to less than one foot here, making it quite difficult
to continue without slipping and sinking into the depths of the pool
below, where thousands of imagined fates may lie. The glint of gold
is visible below, attracting your ever-avaricious eye. Perhaps where
there is great peril there is also great treasure to be found? You are
halfway through the room, and are reluctant to give that up, but the
thought of treasure and magical items is a strong lure to explore deeper.

The ledge bends here again, and to the east it ends before the northern
exit, an open passage containing several steps that head up to dry
corridor! Breathing a sigh of relief, you gather yourself and prepare
to edge along the last few feet to the ledge that leads out of this
dirty waterlogged chamber. Strange cries can suddenly be heard, cries
of frustration and anger; they appear to be coming from below the surface
of the murky waters...

It is a welcome relief to be away from the dark and murky wetness of
the passages to the south, and back on dry, solid ground. Whatever
perils may lie ahead, you feel safer facing them on more familiar 
terrain. Sniffing at the air, you catch the smell of oil, lantern oil
to be precise, from somewhere nearby. A solid wooden door is set in
the eastern wall, and from behind it you can detect a low rumbling
sound.

The corridor ends here, before a thick metal door to the north, which
has been designed with an overlapping metal edge on the northern side,
flanging it so that it can only open to the north, i.e, it must be
pushed from this side; any attempt to pull it or to push it from the 
far side would be futile. You can hear a loud scraping sound to the
north, even through the door, as of some large creature dragging itself
across a stone floor. At least the area beyond doesn't appear to be 
filled with water.

The metal door opens onto a rather strange sight. A narrow stone
platform protrudes to the north, heading into the depths of a lake
of boiling water! Panicking, you turn to flee, when you realize that
a translucent field of soft, resilient material, of a magical nature,
is keeping the water out. You cautiously proceed further, heading into
a large dome shaped area, a circular "clearing" in the lake, protected
from the volcano-heated waters by the elastic material of the magical
field. The attraction of this anomaly as the prime feature of this area
is overridden by the profusion of bones and broken weapons that lie
scattered across the floor. Some fell beast lairs here, experienced in
fighting without damaging the dome, and intent on adding to its grisly
collection!

murky undermountain. Wherever Keraptis lurks, or the stolen artifacts,
you will find him!

It seems some of Keraptis' minions have kept their wits sufficiently to
maintain a reasonable standard of living. Several chairs surround a small
dining table, behind which rests a massive bookshelf overburdened with
heavy books of little value. Incense smolders in a small clay pot resting
on the table, near which the remains of a half-eaten meal are arranged. It
seems the diners here were interrupted, recently too for the meals are still

beckoning to you. Also present is the familiar glint of gold; a significant
amount of wealth has undoubtedly fallen into these waters, perhaps you
might be able to acquire some for yourself? To the north, you can see
the far side, another ledge, this one containing a short flight of steps
that heads up to a dry passage, a tempting destination indeed. To the
west lies a narrower section of the ledge, where you might head instead
of continuing in this direction.

Your first thought as you plunge deep into the water is that it is a
lot deeper than you imagined; your ears ache as you head deeper, reaching
an eventual depth of fifteen feet, worried that you can no longer see
the glint of gold, or much else in the murky waters for that matter. A
dark opening leads into an underwater chamber to the east, but the shadowy
figures you glimpsed from the surface may be of a more immediate concern...

water. Shapes move about in the water to the east, seeming to beckon

particularly messy fate. Your death cry echoes around the cavern for
several more seconds, the final act of your now destroyed body. What
little remains sinks into the mud, to join the hundreds of others
who have perished in a similar fashion.

A Dreary Journey~
Trudging through the thigh deep muck that has half flooded this dank
dungeon is far from one of the most pleasant things you have done, and
the tedium of splashing laboriously through several hundred yards of
waterlogged passageways is not helped by the uniformly grey stone walls,
mottled with unpleasant growths, offering no features of interest 
whatsoever. Not a single inhabitant seems to reside in this long stretch
of passage.

The End of the Tunnel~
At this point the dreary passage ends, at the southern end of a regular
stone corridor, measuring ten by eight feet, heading north as far as you
can see (admittedly not a great distance in these corridors). The walls
of this corridor are lined with a series of copper plates, for whatever
purpose, that dimly reflect the illumination from your light source.
Steam can be seen rising from the water in the distance; not a good sign.

The Induction Field~
As you proceed warily down the corridor, you notice a slight, but 
definite, increase in the air temperature. At first a welcome relief
from the damp chill, it quickly becomes unpleasant enough that you pause
to wipe beads of sweat from your face, and cringe at contact with the 
metal in your equipment. Small blisters are beginning to form on the
areas of skin closest to the metal, and you realize that proceeding
further will only mean suffering even greater temperatures.

You proceed, sweating and swearing as the temperature soars. Water
steams around your feet, and you tear at the items of equipment scalding
your skin. Damn its hot! Finally it becomes too much; fuming, you 
tear the equipment from your back and dash north, eager to be out of
this accursed heat trap as quickly as possible!

The End?~
At last! Free from the blistering heat, you pause in the water, which
is only ankle deep here, and collect your wits. But your rest is to be
very short-lived; many predators are eager to strike at unwary adventurers
when they are least prepared, and in your exhausted and naked condition
you are a prime target! A possible escape route to the north, up a set
of stairs to a dry corridor, is your only other option.

A Dry Corridor~
The stairs end in a small corridor, which runs south for a short distance
to a point where it ends at a wooden door, devoid of markings or trappings.
Its metal handle is free of corrosion, and it appears as if it will open
easily, though your frayed nerves and suspicious nature lead you to imagine
all sorts of hidden threats behind its seemingly innocuous surface.

An Empty Hall~
Flinging the door open, you leap in with weapons drawn, expecting (and
fearing) the very worst. But all that greets you is an empty hall, the
walls and floor of which are lined with shiny metal. Not a speck of dust
nor trace of any markings mars the surface; it shines with an unrivaled
sheen that would make the most devoted dwarven metalsmith jealous. To
the west it ends in a dead end, with no obvious exits, though that is a
good thirty yards away; a lot can happen in thirty yards...

The Frictionless Room~
Relaxing slightly when a thorough examination from the entrance revealed
no potential threat, you are taken totally by surprise when on your first
step you slip and land on your behind, bruising it badly! But you don't
stop there; as you connect you begin to slide, bouncing into one of the 
walls, then rebounding into another, skidding across the floor with no
control over your movements whatsoever. Confused and a little frightened,
you put your hands out in an attempt to slow your movement, but to no avail.

Safety?~
You slide through the illusory wall that barred the end of the eastern
corridor, and land in a room with a more conventional surface- that of
cold, hard grey stone. The walls, floor and ceiling are uniform in their
similarity and their lack of interesting features. Only a plain wooden
door, set in the north wall, affords any variety.

A Short Corridor~
This short, even corridor runs west a short distance from the door to
a junction. The air here is still, and musty; not many intruders make
it this far into the dungeons of Keraptis. You can sense, even here,
the eyes of the mad mage upon you, watching your every move with mild
(but growing) interest. You do not doubt that he will be totally prepared
for your arrival when you do finally find him. And find him you will!

Gloomy stone passageways head into the darkness to the north, east and
south, none of them standing out from the others in any way, visually
at least; the sound of running water can be distinctly heard to the
north. The floor here is covered in muddy footprints, heading from the
north southwards, along the passageway towards whatever may lie in 
that direction.

A Curious Anomaly~
Reaching the end of the corridor, you stop short in the large chamber
that lies at the northern end, staring in wonder at the fascinating
feature it contains. Running through the center of the room, with no
visible means of support, is a small river, complete with fish and various
other forms of marine life, flowing swiftly from a hole in the east wall,
through the center of the chamber, and into a hole in the west wall. It is
possible to walk underneath the river, which "flows" about three feet off
the floor, and is approximately five feet wide. Surely this is one of the
most unusual sights you have seen yet! The hole that admits the water is
large enough that it could well accomodate a brave mariner in a small
watercraft, though the strength of the current is such that travel would
only be possible in one direction, i.e, to the east.

The stream disappears into the darkness ahead of you, rushing swiftly along
its winding route, through the rough hewn tunnel. At no time does the water
actually rest on the rocks; it is as if it is held in place by some magical
field. Blind subterranean fish dash here and there, disturbed by your
presence. You have no choice but to continue with the current.

Ambush!~
The stream pours into and through another stone chamber, this one dully
lit and boasting greasy stone walls and floor. The ceiling is caked with
thick red paint, some of which has peeled off, revealing the original grey
stone beneath. The river bends in the center, heading through another hole
in the east wall, which the current drags you irresistably towards. There
is little else of interest in the chamber, save a faded mural on the
southern wall.

The passage bends here, heading to the base of a stairwell that heads
up out of the water.

A Way Out...?~
The waterfilled passageway ends here, at the base of a corroded iron
stairwell, mostly overgrown with mold and other marine growths. Peering
upwards, you can see a yellow stone chamber, apparently dry, which lies
above the water level, and forms the second tier of this section of the
dungeon. Proceeding here will take you one step closer to the summit of
the mountain, and presumably one step closer to Keraptis.

A Sandy Passage~
The floor of this dry stone passage is covered in sand, stained at various
intervals with blood and other substances. The air is hot and dry, and you
find yourself wishing for a bit of water, even so shortly after having been
immersed in it. A faint scuttling sound can be heard, as of spiny, bony
legs scraping on the floor, scratching at the yellow stone beneath the sand.
Accompanying this is a deep, booming laughter that reverberates through the
passage, which is beginning to feel like a tomb. You are close to the source
of the madness now, close to Keraptis himself.

A Sandy Passage~
The walls here are of a yellow stone, not dissimilar to the color of the
sand, which looks out of place here, in this damp subterranean lair. But
you find it hard, despite knowing full well where you are, to dispel the
feeling that you have been magically transported to some ancient ruin in
the Western Desert, there to be entombed with the rotting remains of the
ancient pharaohs of that wasteland.

A Sandy Passage~
The walls in this section bear simple murals, two dimensional representations
of women being ravaged by jackal-headed men of immense proportions, and
giving issue to vile half-human half-canine hybrids that rampage wantonly
through the streets of some unknown city. Keraptis is a wicked man, and has
many wicked deeds in his past. He is also apparently much older than you at
first realized; several images of a laughing man clad in robes of crimson
dominate many of the murals, a figure you can only assume to be the mad mage
himself.

The End of the Passage~
The passage bends here, ending at a small set of stairs, that winds
upward into the darkness, towards the highest tier of this series of
spirtalling corridors. You presume that you have gradually worked your
way up into the mountain, and must be near the peak now; yet there is
no real way of telling just exactly where you are, or how far you have
travelled. All that remains is the next step, each time seeming to be
the end, but in reality only an entrance to a series of new trials.

A Sandy Arena~
The stairs open onto a large chamber, a yellow stone affair with a
high domed roof supported by iron statues of jackal, ibis and leopard,
standing on their hind legs and supporting the roof with upraised arms
or their heads. Strange black tendrils of magical energy writhe around
and between the statues, radiating cold and evil. Only the southern wall
is devoid of trappings or tendrils. The sand on the floor is stained 
crimson with blood, and is littered with dozens of half devoured corpses
in various states of decomposition. What manner of vile beast would lair
here?

Corridor of Peril~
You pass from the dry heat of the arena into the damp chill of a 
narrow tunnel, the likes of which you had grown accustomed to in the
earlier sections of the dungeon. The walls are of black stone, slick with
moisture and various growths. A dull, booming sound reverberates through
this section of the corridor, and you begin to detect the unmistakable
stench of Chaos in all of this.

The Final Curtain?~
The tunnel ends here, suddenly and without warning, in a dead end. 
Only a thick purple curtain is of note; the rest of the area is without
interesting features. The booming sound is louder now, and the laughter
has returned, high-pitched and maniacal. Waves of nausea pass over you as
you stand here, and you double over, clutching at your stomach, hoping 
the sensation will pass. It doesn't. Gritting your teeth, you look for a
way to continue.

An Opulent Gaol~
Flinging open the curtain, you stride forth not into the dismal
lair you expected, but rather into a very well apportioned chamber,
replete with lavish furnishings, ornate sculptures, intricately woven
tapestries, and a sumptuous divan, upon which the "prisoner" of this
chamber reclines. A pile of treasure has been shoved underneath the
divan, and the glint of gold is an irresistible lure to investigate
this place further. A large metal door, with an ugly iron lock, is
subtlely concealed by gossamer veils and strips of soft cloths.

A Filthy Den~
You had no idea what to expect, as you journeyed here in search of the
mad mage, at the end of your quest, but you are certain that you certainly
didn't expect Keraptis to be living in such abject squalor as this. Ruined
furniture, draped with the shredded remains of moldering tapestries, fills
the small, damp chamber, which drips constantly with water. Torn, stained
carpet crunches underfoot as you crush broken glass into it. Torn spellbooks
lie on the scorched remains of wooden bookshelves, lining each wall. A
gaping hole in the west wall leads to another section of the study, while
a similar wound in the stonework of the ceiling reveals a crumbling stair
leading up- a possible escape from this lair if needed. Somewhere within 
this mess lurks the mad mage himself, living up to his name at least.

A Fiery Chamber~
The rubble strewn chamber revealed by the hole in the wall contains
very little of interest, save for several small smoldering braziers,
arranged at the points of a pentacle graven into the black stone floor.
The air here is dry, and hot, hurting your throat as you gasp for breath.
The unmistakable stench of sulfur compounds your breathing difficulties.

The Crumbling Stair~
A narrow, partially ruined staircase wends its way up here, through
the hole and up towards a glowing, shimmering portal, through which 
you see a very familiar sight. The air is dry here, and rather hot,
causing pain when you gasp for breath. The stench of sulfur is strong,
and you occasionally feel waves of heat, similar to those you felt in
the heart of the volcano while battling the Crab.
