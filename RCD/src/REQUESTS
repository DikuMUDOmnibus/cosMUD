Subject:  Evil Shopkeepers                                                      

The problem with shopkeepers saying this all the time is line 810 in
update.c which says:
if (ch->last_carrying && find_keeper(ch)!=ch)
which is BAD because find_keeper is meant to be called only when
people try to use the mob not every tick. The reason for this check
is to ensure that shopkeepers don't hold their inventory, something
which it obviously isn't very sucessful in doing because it doesn't work
for some reason. To fix the problem, change the line to:
if(ch->last_carrying && IS_NPC(ch) && ch->pIndexData->pShop == NULL)
which avoids calling the find keeper func and takes only the one check
from it that the condition is actually interested in. I'm not so sure this
will fix the shopkeepers' holding inventory anymore, but with a bit of luck
it will do that too.

fight.c, line 3855:
sprintf( buf1, "$n's poisoned %s %s $N%c", attack, vp, punct );
sprintf( buf2, "Your poisoned %s %s $N%c", attack, vp, punct );
sprintf( buf3, "$n's poisoned %s %s you%c", attack, vp, punct ); 
should be:
sprintf( buf1, "$n's poisoned %s %s $N%c [%d]", attack, vp, punct, dam 
sprintf( buf2, "Your poisoned %s %s $N%c [%d]", attack, vp, punct, dam 
sprintf( buf3, "$n's poisoned %s %s you%c [%d]", attack, vp, punct, dam
(without the end truncated :]) this makes the [damage] show up for poisoned
weapons too since this one was forgotten in the addition. ([%d] should be:
&R[&Y%d&R]&W)

There is some ambiguity about the meaning of itemvalues on corpses. This has
caused slice to not function. To fix:
First, animate dead is using something that doesn't make sense. When corpses
are made, v3 is a pkill flag, v2 is the timer, and it starts at 6 not 100.
magic.c:5154 (in spell_animate_dead())
(mob->max_hit * corpse->value[3]) / 100
should be
(mob->max_hit * corpse->value[2]) / 6
slice has similar problems, only they are critical to its function:
skills.c:5432 (in do_slice())
if (corpse->item_type != ITEM_CORPSE_NPC || corpse->value[3] < 75)
should be
if (corpse->item_type != ITEM_CORPSE_NPC || corpse->value[2] < 4)
skills.c:5438 (in do_slice())
if ( (pMobIndex = get_mob_index((sh_int) -(corpse->value[2]) )) == NULL )
should be (-cost stores the vnum not v2):
if ( (pMobIndex = get_mob_index((sh_int) -(corpse->cost) )) == NULL )
skills.c:5480 (in do_slice())
corpse->value[3] -= 25;
should be
corpse->value[2] -= 2;

More available symbols for diceformulas, specifically hit and damroll!
magic.c:706, just add in after the line:
    case 'Y': case 'y':return get_age(ch);
case 'E':case 'e': return get_exp(ch);
case 'G':case 'g': return(ch->gold);
case 'R':case 'r': return(ch->hitroll);
case 'D':case 'd': return(ch->damroll);
more suggestions:
a, ch->carry_weight
b, ch->carry_number
saving_poison_death, _wand, _para_petri, _breath, _spell_staff
ch->alignment
ch->height
ch->weight
ch->armor
ch->mental_state

Major pain in the @$$ bug that prevents rescue from ever working:
skills.c:2535 (do_rescue())
    if ( !ch->fighting )
    {
    send_to_char( "Too late...\n\r", ch );
    return;
    }
should obviously be:
    if ( !victim->fighting )
    {
    send_to_char( "Too late...\n\r", ch );
    return;
    }

Subject:  Arena re-join bug                                                     

Arena re-entry code fix:
 
if (((current_time-ch->logon) / 60) <= 5) {
 send_to_char("You have to wait 5 minutes after logon before you can 
 join the arena.\r\n",ch);
 return;
}
 
This wants sticking in arena.c with the other arena join player checks.
 
This is also being discussed on the web board in the "Bug Reports" forum
under a thread titled "Arena Bug".

Subject:  Litterbug Bug                                                         

PLR_LITTERBUG happens to be equal to ACT_NOASSIST and there
in a missing IS_NPC() check so any mobs with flag noassist cant drop
stuff. To fix, add a IS_NPC( ch ) & before the checks for xIS_SET(
ch->act, PLR_LITTERBUG ) - one misc.c:1615, one (more important)
act_obj.c:894.

Subject:  PKILL suggestion.                                                     

Hello,
 
One thing I've noticed is that a lot of the pkillers seem
to ignore the fact that they can only take one item 
from the corpse of their victims.
I promose that a change in code be implemented that physically
limits a pkiller from looting more than one item.
Obviously, I know nothing about programming, so
maybe one of you code-savvy people could look
into implementing this limitation.
 
Danke.
