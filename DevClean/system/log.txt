Cyph: a friend of mine fixed one of those in like 2 seconds
Bloodaxe: i mailed fellon about that.
Bloodaxe: he didn't even know.
Bloodaxe: Like, it shouldn't be possible to make 20 levels a day..
Cyph: see, in resortmud, it's kinda easy to get early levels
Cyph: but once you go up to say 50 or so, then it takes forever to gain levels
Bloodaxe: ok. htat's not so bad then.
Cyph: like, in smaug, it's pretty easy to get the first 10 levels too
Bloodaxe: Would you like a badge? (chat)
Cyph: but there are 50 player-available levels in smaug
Cyph: 100 in resort
