<p>These rules are currently being developed, rules will be added / changed /
removed, they will mostly be along these lines however.
Suggestions/comments to<a href="mailto:prage@sdf.lonestar.org"> Prage</a> or
 <a href="mailto:fellon@sdf.lonestar.org">Fellon.</a></p>


<h3>The Rules</h3>
<p>No direct reference to a character should appear in any descriptions, in
particular room descriptions(example "You feel weary from your travel"), a 
generic reference might be feasible in an extra description, where something 
might be written on a wall.</p>

<p>All relevant rules in room titles should begin with a capital letter.</p>

<p>All descriptions should have an even alignment of about 80 character columns,
this makes them neater and easier to read. An even spacing should also be
used.</p>

<p>Room descriptions should be brief and informative, no need to give an entire
lecture on the room, just what is seen upon first viewing it, by whatever
means are used to view it. Extra descriptions are for details.</p>

<p>All mob and objects should contain at least one keyword in their long
description, and preferably in their short description also.</p>

<p>Death traps should be kept to a minimum, and when used should be done so with
strategy, for now there is a limit of one death trap per hundred vnums.</p>

<p>Mazes should be used only when needed.</p>

<p>When building online, modifications to other builders areas should be kept
to a minimum, small bug fixes are ok, be sure that a note is made regarding
it however.</p>

<p>If the location where the area will be linked in is unknown before building
starts, then no assumptions should be made.</p>

<p>All mprogs must be approved by the code council.</p>

<h3>Information Room Format</h3>

<p>The first room of every new area should be reserved for builder information.
The rooms must follow a common format so that a builder/immortal can easily
understand a new area.</p> 
<p>The room should be flagged noastral and nosummon, and should have no
entrance or exits.</p>
<p>The room title should contain the area name preferably with the area file
name in brackets following it, i.e. "The Swallows Inn(swallows.are)"
The description should be an area description, this is intended for builders
so OOC stuff can (and should) be used.</p>

The following extra descriptions should also be used;<br>
<p>* DT, DTs: The vnums of all death traps in the area.</p>
<p>* vnum, vnums: A summary of vnum usage, free/used vnums.</p>
<p>* note, notes: An index of all notes, see following;</p>
<p>* note0.. note1.. noteN: Any builder notes/comments that the builder feels
should be added(potential bugs are a good one). If no notes are used the ed 
"note and notes" should contain a message that no notes have been used.</p>
<p>* reset, resets: This should contain a list of all resets involving objects or
mob from other areas.</p>
<p>* transfer, transfers, teleport, teleports : This should contain a list of all 
transfers via mprogs or room flags to other areas.</p>
<p>* mprog, mprogs : Brief index of mprogs, as follows;</p>
<p>* mprog0.. mprog1.. mprogN: References to all mob, objects or rooms with
mprogs, by vnum.</p>

<p>In the case that some of these aren't used(i.e. no objects/mobs from other
areas) then the ed should still exist with an appropriate message.
Another item for the notes would be suggestions for the location where the
area is to be linked, from where it should be linked etc.</p>

<h3>New Builders</h3>

<p>All new builders in addition to reading an actual building guide ( such as
herne's guide) should consider reading a building style guide, such as the
Wheel Of Time (WOT) building guide, or Moondancer's guide to smaug building.
