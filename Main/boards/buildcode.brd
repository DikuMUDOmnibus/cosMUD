As may be noticed, darkhaven is getting a face lift.
Input is appreciated, which is why this board has been added here,
so if anyone would like to see changes to darkhaven post the idea here.

-Keep existing VNUMS with similar functions so we don't break areas that
depend on them for invoking std mobs or trasferring to certain spots.
- Put in a room with a locker flag.
- Leave the general street layout the same (newbies get lost enough already)
- Keep it simple

Hi,
 
I happened to notice that we have some areas that
look like they where designed for smaug with
the 1-50 level range. (eg: Hochenyana)
 
Might it be a good idea to modify some of
these areas to the Resort Mud equivilant
eg: Hochenyana would be level 80-100
 
Some of the boss mobs in these areas
(eg: Kerpatis and the World Eater) would seem
to suit higher level chars.
 
Just a thought.

That might be an idea, some areas are more suited for higher (or lower)
than suggested. However when it comes to complete upgrade of the area
including mob and objects that will be a bit much, it would nearly need
to be rebuilt, and would probably be better building it from scratch.
Methods for building things from scratch are being looked at.

I think it should be fairly easy to relevel areas.
 
Most of it could be handled by multiplying levels by two.  I'd
have to see some ResortMUD areas to see what the typical
damage/hp differences are for mobs compared to the Smaug level system.
 
If/When the ResortMud code is available again for download, I'll
take a look and see if I can come up with a convertor.

if you're relevelling area's, make sure you fix some equipment too.
I'm thinking blackrazor here, level 52 is way to low for a weapon like
that.
All other weapons with that damage are all level 70-90, like they are
supposed to be :)
