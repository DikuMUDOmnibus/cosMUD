Ahh, thank you Marten. I am sure this board will get little use. :-)
Well since there are only two clerics in this guild.

What does anyone think about the class descriptions for clerics?
I think we should open up the topic here so that we don't miss out in
this opportunity to change a few things in the class.

Guild Items?
 
So any ideas for what the guild items should be? I was thinking of items
that can be worn in places that do not commonly have items, such as: ankle
, back, face, floating, ear.
Ankle would be the best option since we could wear it on two of the locations.
Something ideas for the ankle item would be, a charm anklet, shackles, or
tattoos.
 
Think about it.
