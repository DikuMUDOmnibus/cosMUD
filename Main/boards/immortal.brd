I have made a website for the newbie council (not totally complete yet)
and am hosting it on my unix box for the time being. I haven't been around
lately because my cable got shut off and the company really sucks so i have
to wait 3 - 5 business days for the internet (i stole an aol acct for now).
 
I have to find a good host for the site, (any ideas?). As soon as thats 
done i can upload it and it can be available. I WOULD just host it off my
box but i'm not the only one to use this computer and people like to switch
between winblowz and unix, so it wouldn't always be up. As soon as i get my
own appt. I will have it hosted on my box and it WILL be up 24/7.
 
Whats going on with the council anyway? I know you killed it but i'm not sure
exactly why. And wether you have plans to re-implement it.

The problem with shopkeepers saying this all the time is line 810 in
update.c which says:
if (ch->last_carrying &&&& find_keeper(ch)!=ch)
which is BAD because find_keeper is meant to be called only when
people try to use the mob not every tick. The reason for this check
is to ensure that shopkeepers don't hold their inventory, something
which it obviously isn't very sucessful in doing because it doesn't work
for some reason. To fix the problem, change the line to:
if(ch->last_carrying &&&& IS_NPC(ch) &&&& ch->pIndexData->pShop == NULL)
which avoids calling the find keeper func and takes only the one check
from it that the condition is actually interested in. I'm not so sure this
will fix the shopkeepers' holding inventory anymore, but with a bit of luck
it will do that too.

Hm, I just noticed something. Terri has created a (yet another) new character
except this time, the new character race is Immortal (30). Anyone has any idea
how that happened?

After talking to Terri, I was able to recreate the Immortal race issue.
When you create a new character, select Humans and then the next choice that
is presented to you is either Human or Immortal. After you select Immortal, you
are able to select from a few different classes, most of which are classes
starting with Were*.
Immortal race starts off with 10020 hp, but the base hp is still set to 20. 
There are a bunch of useful aff_bys provided to the Immortal race though, so 
it would be nice if the race was pulled off the list.

I just modified the Immortal race so that no class can be used with the race.
Naturally, the race still has to be removed from the "Humans" list.

Necro.are is offline; as is Reign.are.
Both had stupidly powerful weapons (like doing 3500+ damage, etc).
And Necro.are had a slay program that I don't like either.
Are our builders getting guidelines for power levels?

I suggest comment comm.c lines 1290-1292 to remove the restriction that
you can't enter the same command more than 20 times. I think this should
be done, since it makes people quit all the time while using commands like
"kick" "meditate" etc which are perfectly valid and has no effect on real
spam where people abuse the channels.

Everyone in this game is in welmar's painting in the art gallery levelling
all together and no where else. They are all fighting over who gets to
kill them every time. In the interest of encouraging exploration, since
most new players don't eevn know where any area is except the art gallery,
I propose giving welmar a bit more bang for the exp he gives. <eg>

That would be right, tested as a mortal same effect.
I'm surprised no one thought of this before, but i'd be amazed if argon
hadn't, all in all, if he has, he's handled pretty well ( no gavels).
 
for now i changed possess to charm, and now i really don't think possess is rea
dy.
