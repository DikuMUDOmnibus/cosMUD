a strange doubleing in 'gr' command:
[35 PsiWarrior] Haroun           ????/???? hp ????/???? mana ????/???? mv ?????
is above the regular readout
[35    Psi]  Haroun         721/721     389/389   ===    617  human  1955100
character seems to act normally. Good luck/s

The exit leaving miden'nir north to the bridge has been linked to the
room gazing upon mt doom, making it not possible to get out.
