------------
These are my ideas, if you'd like me to implement them, argon
let me know.
I think we should have a trophy room, where we can put 
momentos from our Pkills and mob kills (hard to kill mobs)
 
We should also try having a stratagy room where we can decide
on our battle plans. 
 
Another Idea.... we might want to have a teleportation room
where we can zap to popular places, and cause some trouble.
 
Well... I will think of some more soon. :)
Happy killing.
-Maelstrom
