1. Where can we practice mount?
2. Where can we practice climb?
3. What is the use of Pianissimo and visitation?

Hey zel, i'm here to answer a few of your questions :)
First, you can mount certain pets, such as a warhorse or
the other horse that is for sale.
You can ride them, saving you movement point and you'll
look extra cool.
You can practice climb somewhere in the dragon exports
I think, there is a room with Prilla in it
Now about those skills I cannot tell you what they are,
I think pianissimo is a powerup spells of some sort...

1. Go to Tullfuhrzky Manor and mount the horses in the back.
2. Go to Dwarven Daycare and climb the tree or Shattered Refuge and climb
   the cliff.
3. Pianissimo is a group heal (I think) like fortify but probably better
   and visitation is the same thing as astral walk but it's better cause
   it's a skill like mistwalk but it works in the day I think.
Oh and there is also a good spot in Shattered Refuge to practice search in
case anyone needs that.

hello my fellow Imms,
   i will like to start out with the oath that i make all incoming 
members agree to before they enter our guild.
 
1. do you promise to uphold and serve the Guild of Mages to the
best of your ability?
2. Do you promise to play with an un-yeilding yern to level for self
improvement.
3. Do you promise to play fair, respecting all imms, and helping any and
i dont wanna go overboard here. but i just dont want a ton of my members
quitin to go to the rdaf or another guild.  thanks as always for the time guys.
 
                              -HamSpiced
within the first question i ask if they promise to uphold and serve
it was brought to my attention that any member that wants to be outcasted
is breakign that rule, so that means they can be punished correct?
i dont want to go over board on it and i dont want tons of members quiting 
on me so i propose...when a member wats to leave the guild....
find out how long the member has been resident of the guild
by levels....take the numbe rof levels they have gained while in the guild
multiply it by two, the resulting answer will be how much Hp they lose

About Prilla (Dragon Exports virgin), someone knows
how to rescue she? Is it possible?
 
And now, for all of you that want to have a 95% in
"search", there is a room in Dragon Exports where if
you use the command search you will find a key...
If you have 94%, do it a few times (about twice) and...

Cook is used to cook objets of type "cook" which would poison you if
you ate them raw. These should include body parts from dead mobs, but
they are "food" already (they come pre-cooked off the corpse)
so you don't have to cook them. Also the cook skill doesn't recognize
the right vnum for fire so it doesn't work anyway because it doesn't
think a fire is the fire it requires.
No you can't save prilla, though you can charm her and take her out there is no
actual saving program, it's not a bug, just wasn't made.
You can practice search in shattered refuge without having to wait for
objects to repop, but finding where is up to you. :]

Hey guys, this is what happened.
In my slist (augurer) was Berserk Style, I never knew how to use it.
So I asked and people told me to do 'style berserk' to use it.
now, the problem is, I cannot cast while in it. being a caster
this is not good :)
The thing is I cant get out of it.
I cant use standard style, evasive, .. or any other.
Hence, I'd greatly appreciate if this could be fixed.
And possibly remove it from the slist :)
Thanks!

Knights get nothing after level 50, some classes get only one or two things,
some classes get lots. It all depends on your class and there is nothing
wrong with it because spells are supposed to be spread out more at high
levels and close together at low levels. It's perfectly natural.

Ok, we had a small issue last night when someone forgot to sacrifice
a darkhaven guard, and the only reason that he seemed to be upset about
the consequence was because he supposedly didn't know. SO.. i suggest that
EVERYONE read the 'help sacrifice' helpfile, FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. Just WHY
is it a law to sacrifice the guards? They carry a good amount of equipment.
When you kill them and leave the corpse there to rot, it eventually decays
out of existance, leaving all of it's eq behind. Now this, in turn begins
to add up as people go around killing guards and leaving corpses. All that
eq just laying around LAGS the mud because its more stuff that the mud has
to handle. Not to mention that it makes the town look like a dump. 
So, with that said, don't forget to read the 'help sacrifice' helpfile, and
happy sacrificing!
