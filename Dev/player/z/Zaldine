Lastname ~
Bio          Raised in the outskirts of darkhaven zaldine has spent many years
training and learning the art of the mage.  He has no parents that
are known of, and some say that he has killed them.  Although generally
kind to his fello mages, he is one to be weary of.  His pastimes include
killing all the city guards that he sees.  When young the guards would always
conquer over his attemps to kill them, so now he takes his revenge.
always avoid his portals, and remember.. zaldine will kill you.
