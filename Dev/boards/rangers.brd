first I want to congradulate master on achieving guild membership, welcome
master.
 
Second, from now on, since the board is working again, all submissions for
guild entry must be posted here, on a seperate note for each person. Council
will decide wether one is worth of joining, anyone may post a submission on
behalf of any ranger, assuming he or she meets the requirements.
 
Third, there are 4 active guild members, two are in leadership postions, meanin
when a fifth is inducted, elections for council will be held. Policy of
term of office for council shall be decided by council itself, and all meetings
posted on the message board.

Cool we have a board!!!  Now i can ask all 
those burning ranger questions i've had from time to time.
Unfortunately i can't remember any at the moment but I will remember eventually
I do have 1 question that is more asking for
oppinions then anything else:
I know rangers should always explore constantly but
is there any reason why we couldn't post directions to differant areas
on this board to be shared with other guild members?
I always do my best to share locations with guild members whenever I find somet
something good, but since we usually have differant times we are in the
realm, it would be useful to be able to report new and interesting places
on our board so they are available to all.
Whadya think?
-Exu

there are now about 60-70 ninjas roaming around darkhaven.
snake eyes has not been seen for some time, however.
because of the way they move, it is now pretty much
impossible to kill one of them, as another will enter the room
while you're fighting.
however, attacking, fleeing and recalling seems to leave them 
stuck as being visible ;)
post any ideas you may have.

Ninja Spies can invoke more spies.
Snake Eyes is the lesser of 3 bosses.
One of the others is called Solar Snake, and has -20000hp
We must group with other guilds/ordeers and go after them.
Jurg, Zenital and I could together defeat Snake Eyes, but he's too tough for an
any individual (Dunno bout Aeshma and Aella)
we need to go in a group of probably 10 at the very least to have a chance
do not take anyone on alone.
if you see snake eyes, recall and enter jessica's room, where he
cannot attack
(he can still follow you though
)
will post again as more information is discoverewd

well we know have names of all 3 bosses
Snapper Joe and Solar Snake are big ones, dunno which is bigger
but I suspect Snapper Joe
then there's Snake Eyes who kills anyone and everyone
anyway Tsythia was captured, raped and returned
Snapper Joe said he's retreating his troops (why I think he's the
biggest boss) and wants the holy virgin
(I suppose they thought it was Tsythia, but wasn't)
anyway we have to find out who the holy virgin is
and protect her/him/it
oh, and snake eyes seems to prefer killing mages to rangers for
some reason ;)

well, it turns out snapper joe is a nobody
just pretending to be in on it
the rel big cheese is 'giant snake'
snake eye seems to have left us alone for time being
but we still have all these ninja spies aroun *shrug
holy virgin is something to do with founding of darkhaven, or its
history. The immortal Fairburn will help us by either posting a note
with more information else asking help from higher up to open a new
area where we may be able to learn.
 
until then, train well, and may nature be with you

First I would like to thank graz for his scouting on the ninja situation
Do not attack the ninjas unless you have them outnumberd, try to track them,
let see if we can find their hide out, if found post here, then inform the RDAF
this is more the buisness of the RDAF, but indeed, they only have one ranger in
their employ, and well...Lets find the bastards
 
Nature be with you

p.s. little miss headmistriss is NO virgin, I can tell you that much

To rangers above level 45:
In luskan their's a barkeep named toohey.  Track him and he
will sell shots of undead spirits (recover 300hp) and arcane ale
(recovers apprx 300 mana).  Price is cheaper than violet potions and
more effective.

As you might know, reality is shifting somewhat on the night of 6/4 and
we will all be temporarly gone, but do not create a new char with your same nam
make a new one and attempt to find the other guild members, characters can be
any class, any race but orc, troll, goblin, or orge.

the problem seems to be cleared up,
it is good to see everyone is filling the clearing of comrades with stuff
this allows those who are killed and re-incarnated, and newbie guild members
to get there hands on decent eq. The problem is, its getting cluttered, there
is so much junk its hard to even walk around. Therefore I ask
that only usefull items should be donated, everything else throw away.
