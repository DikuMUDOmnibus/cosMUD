Trespin and i are ripping build to pieces. The main target are any pieces
of equipment that don't match his standard. Anything that is considered
unsalvagable will be deleted.

Howdy.
 
First, I'd like to welcome Ashden to the build server. 
 
Prage/Rathkor, can we have build tasks assigned to people here?
Andy, Trespin and Ashden could use a little direction.
 
My current build project is the slum north of the new city. It's 
using the map from "Broken Steppes" as a skeleton.

Thanks Fellas.

Andy and Ashden are working on newhell.are
Hamspiced and Trespin are free to help.
 
Hamspiced says he can't build well, that's easily fixed.
Trespin will without doubt find something to work on. (However if you want
an area, just ask.)
I'll be working on a bottle of scotch which is open to collaboration.
 
If anyone else wants something to do, contact me and i'll find something.
 
Prage.

Well you have more patience than me with shit like that.
I would have put something like "tar czf backup.tgz $dirs" in

You are one of those sadomasochistic shell script guys... omg..
 
Heh, btw it's nice to see stuff getting done though. Since we both

Sorry that I haven't been around much to work on this city, hopefully
Me and Trespin have gotten it to a point of organization where it
will be easy to start work on it. Right now what we need is room descs.
Read help map3, go to 4000999 and read the vnum ranges, then start at
the new recall point 4000000 and pick a section of the city that looks
interesting to you and start writing in room descriptions. Please don't
set room flags, we will set these all at once. The ??? buildings are
unassigned, feel free to make them into anything you want. There is no
organization for mobs or objs yet because we haven't started making them
but if you want to make any I guess just try to pick a number in the
same range that matches close to the room you want to put it in.

Pick any room with a ??? on the map to start building your guild, then
pick a range out of the extra vnums 4000400 - 4000799 and post the
numbers you are using here so no one else will conflict with them.
Use the ??? as the entry to the building and the extra rooms however
you like (withing the logic of the map, i.e. building up or down and
not into where other buildings may be) for your guild / building /
special whatever.

Anyway, I mailed fellon about grasp suspiria being unable to be learned from an
 trainer. Now that I have it, it seems to be bugged.
As you probably know, it is supposed to leech life, but it doesn't.
Cyph said it was a problem with the targetting thingie.
Fellon directed me to you, since you're in charge as skills guy now (he says) =
So I'd greatly appreciate it, if you could try and fix it. :-)
thx in advance

Aren't order/guild hqs supposed to take around 10 rooms? We have a few to
build so if you don't use up all 100 let us know so we can use them
for other guilds. In other news...the room descs for the city walls are
complete . . . Woohoo :].

Worked a bit more on newcity.
 
Started kitting out adventurers supplys in room: 4000131
I haven't done the mob yet, but left the objects as resets in the 
room.  I figured this is a good way to know what items belong in
each store.
 
Andy has started some pet mobs in room: 4000144
I had to reallocate the petshop room to make sure the store room
was in an adjacent vnum.

King's Castle Proposal
 
A new area to be created that fills the space in 4k Mud where Taldon will be
placed, above Darkhaven. Currently there is a road, called the King's Road,
that leads to no where in the direction north of Darkhaven. Therefore the theme
of the area could be a castle for some currently unknown King. This castle will
be in the form of the newcity, Taldon.
 
The reason for this is to give some history for the creation of the city of
Taldon. The castle's ruins will be used to create its outer walls, lighthouse,
and other stone structures. The stones from the ruins would be easily moved to
new positions and towers could be converted to buildings inside the city and to
create the light house.
 
The Castle could be fully functioning, in ruins, or run by a hermit king. The
main importance is that the stone structure has to have some resemblance to the
city of Taldon. Magical properties can be created for future stories that
originate within the old castle and permeate into the city of Taldon, such as:
ghosts, curses, points of magical power, a magic stream, etc. This will help
the players relate to the newcity as being created from something that may have
once been familiar.

(King's Castle Proposal continued)
 
Two more areas could be created which are representations of the area as it
gets changed from being a castle to being a port city. The first being right
after the destruction of Darkhaven and the second as the construction period.
Later on these areas can be converted into different places so that there
construction is not wasted. There similarity will be related to a certain time
period where this type of building was the norm i.e. gothic, victorian, modern.
 
Name of the Area: kingcas.are
Start room
  Title: The King's Castle 
  Vnums: 100 (rooms, objects, mobs)
  Death Traps: none
 
 
Please post your Ideas on this matter,
Chimerus.
