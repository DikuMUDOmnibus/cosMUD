a few ideas....
 
an executioner like mob would be cool (to kill bad people) he should also
do less attacking and just slay them or somthing that causes instant death heh
 
old collector like mob but make him not pick anything up if there are mortals
in the room or somthing like that....lots of players get stuff taken and there
is nothing they can do about it
 
ill probly have more later
