Elemental Gateway~
To the west a path dips and winds among some flowing firepits.  To the
northeast a path goes toward the river.  Beyond toward the northeast and
northwest are outcrops which rise up from the canyon floor. To the east there
is a cave mouth which leads into the canyon wall.  And to the south the path
leads up, away, and out of the canyon.  Various pure and cross-breeds of
elemental forms wander the canyon floor, which extends in a wide swath
northwards.

The Floor of the Canyon~
Various elemental forms wander the floor of the canyon.  Some seem to be
going about their business, while others seem to have no business at
all.  In general, it is calm, yet there is always an incessant buzz of
things going on about. The canyon floor extends east and south.  You can
climb a rise in the canyon floor to the north.
