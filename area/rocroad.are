are too far away to tell..

As the small hills along side you taper down you can make out the sheer walls
of the mountains on both sides of you... How you missed them before you
can't tell. You can see the only break between the mountains is ahead of you.

A small fissure along the road~
The well traveled road goes on to the East and to the West, but a small path
leads north into what appears to be a fissure in the mountain side. As you look
through the strained sunlight you can see what appears to be a path leading
further into the mountain.

As you travel along you notice how oppressive the rock walls really are.

the slight brezze that whispers through here.

if they had some help in getting down here from the hieghts.

Have you reached a point near the summit of the Sedune mountains?
Or is this just a break along the way. For now you can enjoy the view along
the mountain pass.

The half point~
The ruts of wagons can be seen traveling into a copse of trees just a bit to
the north. It appears to be a break in the rocks where the sun can shine throug
A real miracle of nature.

is the large wall of granite silhouetting the small fenced in pavillion
of a mid eastern style building.
You can see several types of flowers and shrubs growing along the fence.
It all seems so peaceful and serene.
