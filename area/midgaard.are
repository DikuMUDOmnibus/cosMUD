    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has installed a new no-rent save and quit
        system.  Apparently one can now save and quit at any time
        from anywhere inside a town or out.  My services here are

booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
returns you to Austral Square.
On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival

You are crossing a strong stone bridge, which spans the Midgaard river.
Below you, the river flows into an opening in the city wall, sealed with
strong metal bars.  North of you is wall road, south of here the concourse
