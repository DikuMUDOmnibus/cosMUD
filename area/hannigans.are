Inside Hannigans Inn~
As you step in to the inn a blast of warmth hits you full in the face.
Along with the wonderful smell of backed bread, roasted meat and wood smoke.
As you look around the inn you see several long tables and some smaller
tables spread around the common room.

The Bar is off to the western side of the room.
